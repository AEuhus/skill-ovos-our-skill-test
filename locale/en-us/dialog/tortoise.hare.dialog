Once upon a time, there was a hare who was very proud of his speed. He liked to boast and make fun of the other animals, especially the tortoise, who was very slow and steady. One day, the hare challenged the tortoise to a race. The tortoise accepted, knowing that he had no chance of winning, but he wanted to teach the hare a lesson. The race began and the hare quickly ran ahead of the tortoise. He was so confident that he decided to take a nap under a tree, thinking that he had plenty of time to finish the race. The tortoise, meanwhile, kept moving at his own pace, without stopping or giving up. Soon, the hare woke up and realized that he had overslept. He saw the tortoise nearing the finish line and panicked. He ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise had crossed the finish line and won the race. The hare felt ashamed and learned that being fast is not always enough. Sometimes, being slow and steady can win the race.
