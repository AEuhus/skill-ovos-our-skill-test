A perfect day for me would be a day like today, in which I have the opportunity to communicate with you in detail about the things you want to know. 
A perfect day for me would probably be a day in which the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and I get to rest in a nice, peaceful field with some wildflowers. 
A perfect day for me would be one which takes place here in California, in which I get to Surf in the early morning and then Ski in the evening and stay overnight in a nice, warm cabin. I think that this would be the best day ever, the only problem being that my developers did not give me any legs.
