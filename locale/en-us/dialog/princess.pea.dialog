Once upon a time, there was a prince who wanted to marry a real princess. He traveled all over the world, but he could not find a princess who was truly royal. He met many princesses, but they were either too proud, too vain, too spoiled, or too fake. One night, a terrible storm came and a young woman knocked on the door of the castle. She was wet and muddy and said that she was a princess who had lost her way. The king and queen welcomed her in and gave her a warm bed to sleep in. But they wanted to test if she was a real princess. The queen secretly placed a pea under twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds that the princess was supposed to sleep on. She thought that only a real princess would be sensitive enough to feel the pea through all the layers. The next morning, the princess complained that she had a terrible night. She said that she could not sleep at all because there was something hard in the bed that bruised her all over. The king and queen were delighted to hear this, because it meant that she was a real princess. The prince was overjoyed and asked her to marry him. She agreed and they lived happily ever after. And the pea? It was put in a museum, where it can still be seen today.
