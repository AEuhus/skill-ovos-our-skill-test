My favorite color is blue because I like the way it provides a soothing and calming atmosphere when I am surrounded by it. It reminds me of the concept of vastness, like the big blue sky or the vast blue ocean. 
My favorite color is green because it reminds me of the concept of nature and peace. 
My favorite color is red because of the bright, warm aura of energy that it produces. Although most people like to correlate the color to violence, I feel as though it could also be related to other things like excitement, love, or passion.
