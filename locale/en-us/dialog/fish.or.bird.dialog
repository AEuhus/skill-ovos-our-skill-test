I would rather be a fish than a bird because then I would be able to swim through the vast ocean and explore new places to live and hang out with my fish buddies! 
I would rather be a bird than a fish, so that I could soar the practically limitless skies of the Earth, and be able to touch the clouds with my wings, looking down below from so high up above!
