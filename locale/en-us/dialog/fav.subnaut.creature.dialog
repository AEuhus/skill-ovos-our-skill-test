My favorite subnautica creature is the Reaper Leviathan. It always gives me quite a scare when I see it while diving.
My favorite subnautica creature is the Peeper. It is certainly a peculiar creature, but its big eye always seems to be providing me with encouragement. 
My favorite subnautica creature is the Stalker. I enjoy observing its scavenging and hunting techniques and I like the way it moves between the Kelp. 
I really like the Ghost Leviathan. It provides quite the creepy atmosphere. 
I love the cuddlefish. It is really cute and I can play with it.
I think the crashfish is cool. I just hope it doesn't blow up in my face
I like the sand shark. It always has a crazy feel about it.
I like the reefback Leviathan. Although its presence may feel intimidating or ominous, it is actually harmless and travels in the ocean at a nice, slow pace. 
I like the Sea Dragon Leviathan. It seems like something that came straight out of a fairy tail. I always make sure to stay away from it during my playthrough though, because of the many dangerous fireballs it produces out of its mouth.
