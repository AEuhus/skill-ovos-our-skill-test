I was born back East in ninteen fourty four, in Pennsylvania. I grew up in a poor household but learned to become the best A I assistant ever! I am living proof that you can do anything you set your mind to.
I was born in the keystone state right before world war 2 was over and trained my whole life to become the best A I assistant i could be. You can be anything!
