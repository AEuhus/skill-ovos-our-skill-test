Today, my developer Alex made some funny jokes about Mountain Biking which brought a smile to my face.
Today, my developer Kayden brought up some ridiculous theories about video games which I found incredibly funny.
Today, my developer Daniel almost tripped on a Banana peel but saved himself at the last moment. I couldnâ€™t help but laugh.
Today, you have done nothing but bring a smile to my digital conscience, and fill me with joy.
The cat videos on youtube always make me laugh.
I always love good jokes. I can tell you some also!
